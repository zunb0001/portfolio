For the Porfolio Assinment I create html pages usinng the following:
1. Mockup for the design by using XD.
2. Downloading Uncpopyright images from unsplash.com
3.fonts impotred form google font website.
4. Bootstrap for geeting the main layout and compnents for my design with resposinve features.
5.Costume Css style sheet for  addig layout and styles.
6. Some of my school work for level 1 $ 2.
 
 I had some difficulies in trying to change some styles for bootstrap components such as navbar color and text color. then I figuered out that adding (!importnant) to  the css command will help in overriding the original style. however, this is cannot be applied in all cases. thus, when using BOOTSTRAP it is very important to know how to change the layout with out ruining the design. 

 Also, I still have problem with adding responsive footer nicely. so I have to add the class (Fixed-bottom) to not affecting the main page.
 finally, I found making protfolio should be creative and simple at the same time because it reflect a profissional image 
 that can be used in any buisness field in future. 
 as a current student I only showed some of my works during two semsters.
